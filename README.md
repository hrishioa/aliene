# Aliene

## Getting started

> Note: The project uses Pyaudio so make sure to install the requirements first. 

1. Install requirements. I'm using python 3.10 in conda.
2. Create a .env file with `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
3. Create a directory `./data` to put your files in.
4. Run `aliene.py` - needs sudo for now, and some permissions on Mac.
